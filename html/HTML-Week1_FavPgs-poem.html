	<h2>My Favorite Poem</h2>

	<h3>If</h3>
	<h4><em>by Rudyard Kipling</em></h4>
	<p>
		If you can keep your head when all about you<br/>
		Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br/>
		If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br/>
		But make allowance for their doubting too;<br/>
		If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br/>
		Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br/>
		Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br/>
		And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:
	</p>

	<p>
		If you can dream — and not make dreams your master;<br/>
		If you can think — and not make thoughts your aim;<br/>
		If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br/>
		And treat those two impostors just the same;<br/>
		If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken<br/>
		Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br/>
		Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br/>
		And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:
	</p>

	<p>
		If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br/>
		And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br/>
		And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br/>
		And never breathe a word about your loss;<br/>
		If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br/>
		To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br/>
		And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br/>
		Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!”
	</p>

	<p>
		If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br/>
		Or walk with Kings — nor lose the common touch,<br/>
		If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br/>
		If all men count with you, but none too much;<br/>
		If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br/>
		With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br/>
		Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br/>
		And — which is more — you’ll be a Man, my son!
