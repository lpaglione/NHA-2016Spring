	<h3>The plot</h3>
	<p>Sandy Olsen is a goody two shoes from Austrailia, Danny Zuko is the head T-Bird from Rydell High. However when the two meet up during the summer, they fall in love. But when the summer ends, the two think they'll never see each other again. However they're both wrong, Sandy and her parents have moved to America and she is now attending Danny's school. When the two discover that they attend the same school, there is a lot of debate over whether they can still be together since it's uncool for Danny to be in love with a goody goody like Sandy. However the two, against all odds, manage to stay together. Then graduation comes and Sandy is about to change in a way no one expected.</p>
