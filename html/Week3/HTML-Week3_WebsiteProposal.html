	<h2>The website that I want to build</h2>

	<p class="proposal-text">I want to build a website that showcases all of my new skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and APIs. It will include links to all of the projects that I did, and will explain what I learned during NanoHackers Academy during Spring 2016.</p>

	<h2>Why I want to build this website</h2>

	<p class="proposal-text">I would like to have a reference for other sites that I may build in the future. I will need to include good annotations and comments in my files so that I remember why I made the coding choices that I did.</p>
