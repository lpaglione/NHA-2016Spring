	We originally started this assignment in class, but you should finish it for homework. Your task is to created a web app that allows the user to click a button that returns a random set of five coins (pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters). For example, if the user clicks the button, an example set can beâ€¦

Sample Set 1: 1 penny, 2 dimes, 2 quarters. 		Value:     $0.71
Sample Set 2: 1 penny, 1 nickel, 1 dime, 2 quarters. 	Value:     $0.66

Save all the sets, their values and return the one with the largest value. -->
